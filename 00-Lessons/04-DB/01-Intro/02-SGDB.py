# types of SGDB (Sistemas de Gestión de Bases de Datos)

# Relational DBMS (RDBMS)
# Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server
# Characteristics:
# - Data is organized in tables (rows and columns)
# - Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data
# - Supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties for transactions
# Use Cases:
# - Applications requiring complex queries and transactions
# - Systems with structured data and relationships

# Non-Relational DBMS (NoSQL)
# Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB
# Characteristics:
# - Data can be stored in various formats (document, key-value, column-family, graph)
# - Designed for scalability and flexibility
# - Often does not require a fixed schema
# Use Cases:
# - Big data applications
# - Real-time web applications
# - Applications with unstructured or semi-structured data

# In-Memory DBMS
# Examples: Redis, Memcached
# Characteristics:
# - Data is stored in the main memory (RAM) for faster access
# - Suitable for caching and real-time applications
# Use Cases:
# - Applications requiring low latency and high throughput
# - Session management, real-time analytics

# NewSQL DBMS
# Examples: Google Spanner, CockroachDB, VoltDB
# Characteristics:
# - Combines the scalability of NoSQL with the ACID properties of traditional RDBMS
# - Designed for distributed architectures
# Use Cases:
# - Large-scale applications requiring strong consistency and high availability
# - Cloud-native applications

# Graph DBMS
# Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB
# Characteristics:
# - Data is represented as nodes, edges, and properties
# - Optimized for handling complex relationships and interconnected data
# Use Cases:
# - Social networks, recommendation engines
# - Fraud detection, network analysis

# Time-Series DBMS
# Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, OpenTSDB
# Characteristics:
# - Optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data
# - Efficient handling of large volumes of time-series data
# Use Cases:
# - IoT applications, monitoring systems
# - Financial data analysis, sensor data management

# Object-Oriented DBMS
# Examples: db4o, ObjectDB
# Characteristics:
# - Data is stored in the form of objects, similar to object-oriented programming
# - Supports complex data types and relationships
# Use Cases:
# - Applications requiring tight integration with object-oriented programming languages
# - CAD/CAM, multimedia applications

# Columnar DBMS
# Examples: Apache HBase, Google Bigtable, Amazon Redshift
# Characteristics:
# - Data is stored in columns rather than rows
# - Optimized for read-heavy operations and analytical queries
# Use Cases:
# - Data warehousing, business intelligence
# - Analytical processing on large datasets

# Hierarchical DBMS
# Examples: IBM IMS, Windows Registry
# Characteristics:
# - Data is organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships
# - Efficient for certain types of queries and data retrieval
# Use Cases:
# - Applications with a clear hierarchical data model
# - Legacy systems, file systems

# Network DBMS
# Examples: Integrated Data Store (IDS), TurboIMAGE
# Characteristics:
# - Data is organized in a graph structure allowing many-to-many relationships
# - More flexible than hierarchical DBMS
# Use Cases:
# - Complex data relationships
# - Telecommunications, manufacturing systems

# Object-Relational DBMS (ORDBMS)
# Examples: PostgreSQL, Oracle Database (with object extensions)
# Characteristics:
# - Combines features of both relational and object-oriented DBMS
# - Supports complex data types and user-defined types
# Use Cases:
# - Applications requiring advanced data modeling
# - GIS systems, multimedia applications

# Distributed DBMS
# Examples: Apache Cassandra, Google Spanner, Amazon DynamoDB
# Characteristics:
# - Data is distributed across multiple physical locations
# - Provides high availability and fault tolerance
# Use Cases:
# - Large-scale applications requiring global distribution
# - Cloud-based applications, content delivery networks

# Multi-Model DBMS
# Examples: ArangoDB, OrientDB, Couchbase
# Characteristics:
# - Supports multiple data models (e.g., document, graph, key-value) within a single database
# - Provides flexibility in data storage and retrieval
# Use Cases:
# - Applications requiring diverse data types and relationships
# - Agile development environments, complex applications

# Cloud DBMS
# Examples: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Microsoft Azure SQL Database
# Characteristics:
# - Hosted on cloud platforms, providing scalability and managed services
# - Often offers pay-as-you-go pricing models
# Use Cases:
# - Applications requiring scalability and reduced infrastructure management
# - Web applications, SaaS platforms

# XML DBMS
# Examples: BaseX, eXist-db
# Characteristics:
# - Designed to store and query XML data
# - Supports XQuery and XPath for querying XML documents
# Use Cases:
# - Applications heavily utilizing XML data formats
# - Content management systems, data interchange applications
# Key-Value DBMS
# Examples: Amazon DynamoDB, Riak, Berkeley DB
# Characteristics:
# - Data is stored as key-value pairs
# - Simple and fast for lookups based on keys
# Use Cases:
# - Caching, session management
# - Applications requiring high-speed read and write operations

# Time-Series DBMS
# Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, OpenTSDB
# Characteristics:
# - Optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data
# - Efficient handling of large volumes of time-series data
# Use Cases:
# - IoT applications, monitoring systems
# - Financial data analysis, sensor data management

# Object-Oriented DBMS
# Examples: db4o, ObjectDB
# Characteristics:
# - Data is stored in the form of objects, similar to object-oriented programming
# - Supports complex data types and relationships
# Use Cases:
# - Applications requiring tight integration with object-oriented programming languages
